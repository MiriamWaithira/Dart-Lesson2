# Dart-Lesson2
This lesson entails Functions, Anonymous Functions and Arrow Functions in Dart.
Functions are a block of code that are created to perform specific tasks. They are created when some statements are repeatedly occurring.

Advantages of Functions
1. Avoid Code Repetition

2. Easy to divide the complex program into smaller parts

3. Helps to write a clean code

Notes:
1. Return type: It tells you the function output type. It can be void, String, int, double, etc. If the function doesnâ€™t return anything, you can use void as the return type.

2. Function Name: You can name functions by almost any name. Always follow a lowerCamelCase naming convention like void printName().

3. Parameters: Parameters are the input to the function, which you can write inside the bracket (). Always follow a lowerCamelCase naming convention for your function parameter.

Anonymous Functions
These are functions that are namelsess thet is, they do not have names. They are also called lambda or closure.

Arrow Functions
An arrow function is used to define a function that has a single expression. It uses the => (fat arrow) syntax to return the value of the expression directly without needing a return statement or curly braces {}.
